        <h2 id="intro">Introduction to Web</h2>
        <p>
            Sir Tim Berners-Lee introduced tools such as HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) between 1989-1991, Web browser in 1990, and HyperText Markup Language (HTML) in 1993.
            In 1991, Gopher protocol came up along with HTTP protocol. Which provided access to content through hypertext menus presented as a file system rather than through HTML files.
            In 1993, a new web browser with a graphical user interface (GUI) Mosaic browser was introduced.

        <h2 id="client">Client/Server</h2>
        <p>
            The Client-server model is a distributed application structure that partitions task or workload between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters called clients. In the client-server architecture, when the client computer sends a request for data to the server through the internet, the server accepts the requested process and deliver the data packets requested back to the client. Clients do not share any of their resources. Examples of Client-Server Model are Email, World Wide Web, etc.

        <h2 id="overview">Overview of HTTP</h2>
        <p>
            HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched, for instance, text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more.
